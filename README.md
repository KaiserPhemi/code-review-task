# task-review
The folder "code-review-task" contains four different files. 
The files are: ruby.rb, javascript.js, python.py and laravel.php. Each of the filenames represents the stack with which the file was written. 
The content of these files have been messed up and disarranged.
Fork a file of your stack from the 4 files to your github account. 
Then carry out instructed activities on it.
